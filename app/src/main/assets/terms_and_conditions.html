            Notify: Notifications History Saver is designed for users aged 13 and older, in line with
            privacy regulations such as COPPA (Children's Online Privacy
            Protection Act) and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), which

        <h3>User Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Notification Storage:</strong> You are kindly responsible for
            managing and storing your notifications. The app offers helpful tools
            to assist you with searching, filtering, deleting, and restoring your
            notifications as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>App Selection:</strong> You have the option to choose which
            apps' notifications you'd like to store. Please ensure that these
            settings are configured responsibly for your convenience.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Account Security:</strong> Notify: Notifications History Saver does not require user
            registration. Instead, we use a unique device ID to securely associate
            your data with your device. This allows you to use the app without
            providing personal information. If future updates introduce account
            features, we kindly ask you to be responsible for securing your account
            credentials.

        <h3>Auto-Delete Feature</h3>
        <p>
            Notify: Notifications History Saver gives you the option to enable auto-deletion of notifications
            on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Deleted notifications are stored temporarily in a recycle bin, from which you can restore or permanently delete them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, notifications stored on the main screen are automatically deleted after 3 months (90 days). This automated process helps manage storage efficiently. Please note that once notifications are removed due to the 3-month auto-deletion feature, they cannot be recovered.
        </p>
        <p>
            We kindly recommend reviewing your auto-delete settings and being mindful of the 3-month retention period to ensure no important data is unintentionally lost.
        </p>
